# Feature PRD: Autoclicker

## Overview
A tool that can detect a specific color, text, or other feature at a user-selected screen position, and simulate a mouse click when certain user-defined conditions are met. The tool should support multiple conditions, logical rules (e.g., if 1 or 2 conditions are met), and allow for a configurable delay or popup before clicking.

## Requirements
- User can select a screen position to monitor.
- Detection can be based on color, text, or other features at that position.
- Optional conditions: e.g., if this text is present at this position, then trigger.
- Support for multiple conditions and logical rules (e.g., if 1 of N, if 2 of N, etc.).
- Configurable popup/delay before clicking (e.g., 10s, 5s, or no delay).
- Simulate a mouse click at the detected position.
