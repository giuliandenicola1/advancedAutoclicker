## Technical Implementation

### MouseClicker Class Architecture
- **Position Handling:** Validates coordinates within screen bounds
- **Click Types:** 
  - Single click: Standard left mouse click
  - Double click: Two rapid clicks with configurable interval
  - Right click: Context menu activation
- **Safety Features:**
  - PyAutoGUI failsafe (move mouse to corner to abort)
  - Position validation before clicking
  - Configurable pause between actions
  - Exception handling for click failures

### Clicking Strategies
- **First Position:** Click at first condition's position (default)
- **Center Position:** Calculate center of all condition positions
- **All Positions:** Click at every condition position sequentially

### Integration Points
- **UI Integration:** Seamless integration with existing UI controls
- **Rule Processing:** Works with Rule/Condition objects from config
- **Callback System:** Integrates with delay/popup workflow
- **Error Feedback:** Provides user feedback on success/failure

## Acceptance Criteria Met

✅ **Mouse click is performed at the correct position**
- Precise clicking at detected positions
- Position validation and error handling
- Multiple position strategies for complex rules

✅ **Works reliably on macOS (and cross-platform if possible)**
- PyAutoGUI provides cross-platform compatibility
- macOS-specific testing and optimization
- Failsafe protection for user safety
- Robust error handling for different environments

## User Experience Features

### Click Configuration
- **Click Type Selection:** Dropdown in UI settings
- **Visual Feedback:** Success/failure messages with position info
- **Status Updates:** Real-time status during click execution
- **Error Handling:** Clear error messages for troubleshooting

### Safety Features
- **Failsafe Protection:** Move mouse to corner to abort
- **Position Validation:** Prevents clicks outside screen bounds
- **Confirmation Workflow:** Integration with AC-3 delay/popup system
- **Error Recovery:** Graceful handling of click failures

## Integration with Previous Components

### AC-2 Integration (Detection)
- Uses detected positions from monitoring system
- Processes Rule objects with multiple conditions
- Handles condition position data for clicking

### AC-3 Integration (Delay/Popup)
- Triggered after delay/popup confirmation
- Integrated into proceed callback workflow
- Maintains user intervention capability

## Performance Characteristics

- **Click Accuracy:** Pixel-perfect positioning
- **Reliability:** Error handling and retry capabilities
- **Safety:** Failsafe protection and validation
- **Speed:** Configurable delays for different use cases
- **Compatibility:** Cross-platform with macOS optimization

## Testing Coverage

- **Unit Tests:** Individual clicking functions
- **Integration Tests:** Complete workflow testing
- **Interactive Tests:** User-driven validation
- **Error Scenarios:** Failure case handling
- **Cross-platform:** Basic compatibility testing

The mouse clicking infrastructure is now complete and provides reliable, safe, and configurable click automation that integrates seamlessly with the detection and user intervention systems.
