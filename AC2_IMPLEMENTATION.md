# AC-2 Implementation Summary

## Task: Screen Monitoring & Detection Engine

**Status:** ✅ Complete

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. `detection.py` - Detection Engine
- **Purpose:** Handles color and text detection at specific screen positions
- **Key Features:**
  - Color detection using OpenCV with tolerance settings
  - Text detection using pytesseract OCR
  - Support for multiple comparators (equals, contains, similar)
  - Region-based screen capture for focused detection
  - Error handling and preprocessing for better accuracy

### 2. `monitor.py` - Screen Monitor
- **Purpose:** Coordinates detection and rule evaluation in background threads
- **Key Features:**
  - Background monitoring using threading
  - Rule evaluation with multiple logic types (any, all, n-of)
  - Callback system for rule matches
  - Start/stop monitoring controls
  - Configuration updates without restart
  - Status reporting and error handling

### 3. `ui.py` - Updated UI Integration
- **Purpose:** Integrated monitoring system with existing UI
- **Key Features:**
  - Start/Stop monitoring buttons
  - Real-time status display
  - Rule matched callback integration
  - Proper cleanup on window close
  - Error handling and user feedback

### 4. `requirements.txt` - Updated Dependencies
- Added numpy for array operations
- Existing: opencv-python, pytesseract, pyautogui, pillow

### 5. `test_ac2.py` - Testing Script
- **Purpose:** Validate AC-2 functionality independently
- **Key Features:**
  - Detection engine tests
  - Monitor system tests
  - Rule logic validation
  - Error handling verification

## Technical Details

### Detection Capabilities
- **Color Detection:** RGB comparison with tolerance
- **Text Detection:** OCR with preprocessing for accuracy
- **Region Capture:** Focused screen areas for better performance
- **Error Resilience:** Graceful handling of detection failures

### Monitoring System
- **Threading:** Non-blocking background monitoring
- **Rule Logic:** Support for complex condition combinations
- **Performance:** 500ms check interval (configurable)
- **Callbacks:** Event-driven architecture for rule matches

### Integration
- **UI Integration:** Seamless start/stop from main interface
- **Configuration:** Dynamic rule updates
- **Status Feedback:** Real-time monitoring status
- **Cleanup:** Proper resource management

## Acceptance Criteria Met

✅ **Monitors screen at user-selected position(s)**
- Screen capture at specified coordinates
- Configurable region sizes for detection

✅ **Detects color and/or text as configured**
- Color detection with tolerance settings
- OCR-based text detection
- Multiple comparison modes

✅ **Supports multiple conditions and logic rules**
- Any/All/N-of logic implementation
- Multiple conditions per rule
- Flexible rule evaluation

## Next Steps

AC-2 provides the foundation for:
- **AC-3:** Delay/Popup system will use the rule matched callback
- **AC-4:** Mouse clicking will be triggered by the monitoring system
- **AC-5:** Logging will integrate with the detection and monitoring events

The monitoring infrastructure is now complete and ready for the next components.
